"# IOT-Based-Surveillance-System"Â 
This project is built on an Arduino Pro mini microcontroller, ESP 32-CAM and various hardware components. The overall system is used to securely monitor any given area and get real-time results as pictures (.jpg) and video (.mp4) files.
The result of intrusion by any hot-blodded animal (mammals and birds) will be sent to the user's email address in real-time. This project can be upgraded in the future.
